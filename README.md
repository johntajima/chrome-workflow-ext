# Chrome Workflow worker extension

A chrome extension that allows for manual processing/categorization/etc. of any url.

## How does it work?

Configure with a list of URLs you wish to process. Configure a form that will be displayed on each url to easy add data about the url.

Once workflow begins, you are presented with the next URL and overlayed with the form. You can then add your data as needed, and then press next to get to the next URL. At the end or anytime you can download the results in a CSV (or other format)

### Future

- Ability to query endpoint to get next URL to process
- Ability to upload results to endpoint
- Ability to customize form based on type of url
